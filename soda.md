# SODA in Autonomous Database

## **Introduction**

This workshop aims to help you understanding JSODA

Estimated time: This lab takes approximately 20 minutes.

### About SODA in the Oracle Database

Simple Oracle Document Access (SODA) is a set of NoSQL-style APIs that let you create and store collections of documents (in particular JSON) in Oracle Database, retrieve them, and query them, without needing to know Structured Query Language (SQL) or how the documents are stored in the database.

There are separate SODA implementations for use with different languages and with the representational state transfer (REST) architectural style. SODA for REST can itself be accessed from almost any programming language. It maps SODA operations to Uniform Resource Locator (URL) patterns.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Prerequisites
* Lab: Provision and connect to Autonomous Database

Please 

## **Step 1**: Connect to ADB with SQL Developer Web
1.  Open up your SQL Developer Web worksheet, which is connected to your Autonomous Database, from your database OCI Console as you did in [Lab 1](?lab=lab-1-provision-connect-autonomous#STEP3:ConnecttoyourADBwithSQLDeveloperWeb). Sign in, if necessary; here, we are using the **ADMIN** user.

    Please note that you <i>cannot</i> use your local (on-desktop) SQL Developer for this workshop. 
    However SQLcl can be used instead of SQL Developer Web.

## **Step 2**: Create a collection

## **Step 3**: Access SODA collections with SQL

## **Step 4**: Access SODA with REST
